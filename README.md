# Minecraft Modding Survival Website

For internal Minecraft Modding Survival Server use.

If you are a member of the private server, you should have access to the website.

Thus, if you have any ideas on the front end, feel free to contribute.

Due to security reasons, all methods inside the backend `function.php` have been removed. It just leaves an API/template in the file so that you will not get any error using like visual studio code.

Similarly, if you have any ideas on the backend function which may be required for the front end, feel free to open an issue/ dm me in discord.
